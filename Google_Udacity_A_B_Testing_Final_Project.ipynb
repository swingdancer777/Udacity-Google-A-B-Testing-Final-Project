    "## A. Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.

In the test group, we do not want the screener to *significantly reduce* the number of students who continue past the free trial and ultimately complete the course. This would mean that the net conversion should remain the same (within a confidence interval). Though unexpected, net conversion might increase.

    "The net conversion rate for the test group is about 0.49% smaller than the control group. Although this is not statistically significantly different from the control group using a 95% confidence interval, it is still a decrease in net conversion. In addition, the 95% confidence interval ranges from -1.16% to +0.19%, so most of that range includes a decrease in net conversion. (Usually changes of 1% or more in conversion are considered significant.) Given that Udacity's goal is for gross conversion to decrease but net conversion to remain the same or possibly increase, I would NOT LAUNCH the experiment as the net conversion may decrease by up to 1.16%. \n",
    "\n",
    "If more time is available, I would run the test again and see if the net conversion confidence interval no longer includes a decrease in the net conversion rate, or contains a much small decrease in conversion rate than -1.16%. If the second experiment shows a much lower decrease in net conversion rate, then it might be recommended to run the full-scale experiment. Otherwise, I would recommend spending time and resources on other experiments which may prove more productive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Conclusion:**  Do NOT launch the experiment."
